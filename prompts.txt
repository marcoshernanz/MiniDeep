#codebase

Create a statistics screen that displays how much work I've done each day.

Ditch the implementation I already had, it was just a mock.

I want to have a graph and I want to be able to see a 7d, 1m, 3m, 1y, 5y and all time.

The graph should show how much work I've done.

The screen should have a default view showing important data like the total time of the week, the number of sessions and a bar graph with the time I spent each day. It should also have card with the recent sessions.

Then, I should be able to get to a screen that should show a scatter graph mentioned before.

Use nativewind and react native reusables as much as possible. Also, only use the colors I have defined in my globals.css and tailwind.config.ts files.

#codebase

Create an activity page that shows how much work I've done each day.

On the top, it should show a title with the day.

Below that, it should show 7 buttons with the days of the week, the current day that's selected should be highlighted. I should be able to click the buttons to navigate to those days or swipe left and right in the screen. Also, I should be able to swipe in the buttons to get to the previous or next week.

Below that, it should show be a few circular graphs showing how much work I've done and how many sessions.

Below, I should have a graph with the work distribution, showing how much I've worked in different times of the day.

Below, It should show all of the sessions I've done in that day.

Use nativewind and react native reusables as much as possible. Also, only use the colors I have defined in my globals.css and tailwind.config.ts files. For the graphs, use victory-native.
